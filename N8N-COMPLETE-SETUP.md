# Complete N8N Setup Guide for Kendall's AI API

## What This Guide Does
This guide will walk you through setting up Kendall's AI API in N8N from start to finish. After this, you'll be able to use AI in your workflows to automate tasks.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
- You have N8N installed and running
- You can access your N8N dashboard (usually at http://localhost:5678)
- Kendall's API is running (you'll know it works when the test at the end succeeds)

---

## üìã Information You Need (Copy These Values)

**Save these somewhere - you'll need them:**

| What | Value |
|------|-------|
| API Key | `sk-oatisawesome-2024-ml-api` |
| API Base URL | `https://api.kendall-max.org/v1` |
| Model Name | `llama3.1:8b` |

---

## üöÄ Part 1: Setting Up Your First AI Workflow

### Step 1: Create a New Workflow

1. Open your N8N dashboard
2. Click the **"+ New Workflow"** button (usually top right)
3. You'll see an empty canvas with a "Start" node

**‚úÖ You should now have a blank workflow**

---

### Step 2: Add an OpenAI Node

1. Click the **"+"** button on the canvas (or click the plus icon next to the Start node)
2. A search panel will appear
3. Type: `OpenAI`
4. Click on **"OpenAI"** in the results (it has the OpenAI logo)
5. The OpenAI node will appear on your canvas

**‚úÖ You should now see an OpenAI node connected to your Start node**

---

### Step 3: Configure API Credentials (MOST IMPORTANT STEP)

This tells N8N to use Kendall's AI instead of OpenAI's servers.

1. **Click on the OpenAI node** you just added
2. A settings panel will open on the right side
3. Look for **"Credential to connect with"** (near the top)
4. Click the dropdown next to it
5. Select **"Create New Credential"**

A credential form will appear. Fill it out **EXACTLY** like this:

#### Field 1: API Key
- **Copy and paste this exactly:** `sk-oatisawesome-2024-ml-api`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT type it manually** - copy/paste to avoid typos
- Make sure there are NO spaces before or after

#### Field 2: Base URL (Advanced Settings)
- You might need to click **"Show Advanced Options"** or scroll down
- Look for **"Base URL"** field
- **Copy and paste this exactly:** `https://api.kendall-max.org/v1`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Must include `/v1` at the end
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Must start with `https://`

#### Field 3: Name Your Credential (Optional but Helpful)
- At the top, there's a "Credential Name" field
- Type: `Kendall's AI` (or whatever you want to call it)
- This helps you find it later

6. Click the **"Save"** button at the bottom
7. Click **"Back to Node"** to return to the OpenAI node

**‚úÖ Your credential is now saved! You only do this ONCE - you can reuse it in all workflows**

---

### Step 4: Select the Model

Now that credentials are set up, you need to tell it which AI model to use.

1. You should still be in the OpenAI node settings
2. Look for the **"Model"** dropdown field
3. Click it and type: `llama3.1:8b`
4. Press Enter or select it if it appears in the list

**‚úÖ Model is configured**

---

### Step 5: Choose the Operation

1. Look for **"Resource"** dropdown
2. Select: **"Message"** (or "Chat" depending on your N8N version)
3. Look for **"Operation"** dropdown
4. Select: **"Create"** or **"Send Message"**

**‚úÖ Operation is set**

---

### Step 6: Write Your First Prompt

This is where YOU control what the AI does!

1. Look for a large text field labeled **"Prompt"** or **"Text"** or **"Message"**
2. Click in it
3. Type your first test prompt:

```
Hello! Please introduce yourself and tell me what you can help with.
```

**‚úÖ Your prompt is ready**

---

### Step 7: Test It!

1. Click the **"Execute Node"** button (usually top right of the node panel)
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Look at the **output panel** (usually appears below or on the right)

**What you should see:**
- A green checkmark on the node (success!)
- Output data showing the AI's response
- The response should be a friendly introduction

**‚úÖ If you see a response, IT WORKS! You're done with basic setup!**

---

## üéØ Part 2: Using AI in Real Workflows

Now that you know it works, here's how to use it for real tasks.

### Example 1: Email Summarizer

**What it does:** Takes an email and summarizes it in one sentence

**Setup:**
1. Add a trigger (like "Manual Trigger" for testing)
2. Add an "Edit Fields" node (optional, to create test data)
3. Add your OpenAI node (use the credential you already created)
4. In the OpenAI node prompt field, type:

```
Summarize this email in one sentence:

{{$json.emailBody}}
```

5. Execute and test!

**How it works:**
- `{{$json.emailBody}}` pulls data from the previous node
- Replace "emailBody" with whatever field name you have
- The AI reads the email and returns a one-sentence summary

---

### Example 2: Customer Service Response Generator

**What it does:** Writes professional responses to customer messages

**Prompt:**
```
Write a professional, friendly response to this customer message:

{{$json.customerMessage}}

Keep the response under 100 words and be empathetic.
```

---

### Example 3: Data Classifier

**What it does:** Categorizes support tickets automatically

**Prompt:**
```
Classify this support ticket as either: BUG, FEATURE_REQUEST, or QUESTION

Ticket: {{$json.ticketText}}

Respond with only one word - the category.
```

---

### Example 4: Language Translator

**What it does:** Translates text to any language

**Prompt:**
```
Translate the following text to Spanish:

{{$json.textToTranslate}}
```

---

### Example 5: Content Generator

**What it does:** Generates blog posts, social media content, etc.

**Prompt:**
```
Write a professional LinkedIn post about {{$json.topic}}

Requirements:
- 150-200 words
- Include 3 relevant hashtags
- Professional but friendly tone
```

---

## üí° Understanding Prompts

**The prompt is YOUR instruction to the AI. You control everything!**

### Basic Prompt Rules:
1. **Be specific** - The more detail, the better the result
2. **Use examples** - Show the AI what you want
3. **Set constraints** - Word limits, format requirements, tone, etc.
4. **Use N8N variables** - Pull in data with `{{$json.fieldName}}`

### Prompt Template:
```
[Task description]

[Data to process]: {{$json.data}}

[Requirements/constraints]
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2

[Output format instructions]
```

---

## üîß Part 3: Advanced Setup Options

### Using Multiple AI Nodes in One Workflow

You can use the same credential in multiple nodes:

1. Add another OpenAI node
2. In "Credential to connect with", select "Kendall's AI" (the one you created earlier)
3. Use a different prompt for a different task

**Example workflow:**
```
Start ‚Üí Get Email ‚Üí AI Node 1 (Summarize) ‚Üí AI Node 2 (Generate Response) ‚Üí Send Email
```

---

### Using Variables from Previous Nodes

**To use data from previous steps:**

1. In the prompt field, type `{{`
2. N8N will show you available variables
3. Select the one you need, like `{{$json.email}}`

**Common variables:**
- `{{$json.fieldName}}` - Data from previous node
- `{{$node["NodeName"].json.fieldName}}` - Data from specific node
- `{{$input.all()}}` - All input data

---

### HTTP Request Method (Alternative Setup)

**Only use this if the OpenAI node doesn't work!**

1. Add "HTTP Request" node
2. Configure:
   - **Method:** `POST`
   - **URL:** `https://api.kendall-max.org/v1/chat/completions`
3. Click "Add Header"
   - **Name:** `Authorization`
   - **Value:** `Bearer sk-oatisawesome-2024-ml-api`
4. Set **Body Content Type** to `JSON`
5. In **Body**, paste:

```json
{
  "model": "llama3.1:8b",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "YOUR PROMPT HERE"
    }
  ]
}
```

6. Replace `YOUR PROMPT HERE` with your actual prompt

**To get the response:**
- The AI's answer is in: `{{$json.choices[0].message.content}}`

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid API Key"

**Fix:**
1. Go back to your credential
2. Delete the API key
3. Copy this again: `sk-oatisawesome-2024-ml-api`
4. Paste it (don't type it)
5. Make sure there are no spaces
6. Save

### Error: "Could not connect to API"

**Fix:**
1. Check the Base URL has `/v1` at the end
2. Should be: `https://api.kendall-max.org/v1`
3. Ask Kendall if the server is running

### Error: "Model not found"

**Fix:**
1. Check model name is exactly: `llama3.1:8b`
2. Must be lowercase
3. Must have the colon and "8b"

### No Response / Timeout

**Fix:**
1. Make sure you clicked "Execute Node"
2. Wait 10-15 seconds (AI takes time to think)
3. Check if Kendall's server is running
4. Try a shorter prompt first

### Response is Weird/Wrong

**Fix:**
1. Make your prompt more specific
2. Add examples of what you want
3. Set clear requirements
4. Test with simpler prompts first

## üß™ Testing the API (Outside N8N)

Want to verify the API works before using N8N?

### Test from Terminal/Command Line:

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.kendall-max.org/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-oatisawesome-2024-ml-api" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama3.1:8b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello and tell me what you can do"}]
  }'
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$headers = @{
    "Authorization" = "Bearer sk-oatisawesome-2024-ml-api"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
}
$body = @{
    model = "llama3.1:8b"
    messages = @(
        @{
            role = "user"
            content = "Say hello and tell me what you can do"
        }
    )
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.kendall-max.org/v1/chat/completions" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body
```

## üîê Security Notes

1. **Keep your API key private** - Don't share it publicly
2. **The key in this doc is for you only** - Kendall created it specifically for your use
3. **If the API key stops working** - Contact Kendall for a new one
4. **Data privacy** - Your prompts and data go to Kendall's server, not OpenAI
5. **Local processing** - The AI runs on Kendall's computer, not in the cloud

---

## üí™ Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Reuse Credentials
- Create the credential once
- Use it in ALL your workflows
- No need to create new credentials each time

### Tip 2: Test Prompts Separately First
- Before building a complex workflow
- Test your prompts in a simple workflow with manual trigger
- Once the prompt works, integrate it

### Tip 3: Use System Messages for Consistency
Some N8N OpenAI nodes support "system messages":
- System message: "You are a helpful customer service agent. Always be professional and empathetic."
- User message: "{{$json.customerQuestion}}"

### Tip 4: Handle Long Responses
If responses are cut off:
- Add to your prompt: "Keep your response under 500 words"
- Or increase token limit if the option is available

### Tip 5: Chain Multiple AI Calls
For complex tasks:
1. First AI node: Extract key information
2. Second AI node: Process that information
3. Third AI node: Format the final output

### Tip 6: Save Responses to Database
- Add a database node after OpenAI
- Store questions and answers
- Build a knowledge base over time
